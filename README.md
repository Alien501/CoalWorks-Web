## Problem Statement

**Problem ID**: 1645  
**Problem Title**: An app and web-based software for Productivity and Safety Management of Coal Mines.

Despite the transition towards renewable energy, coal remains essential for India's energy security. The coal industry faces the challenge of achieving a production target of 1.5 Bt by 2030. To meet this goal, improving the productivity and safety of mining operations is crucial.

The problem is divided into two key areas:

1. **Digital Shift Handover Log System**: A streamlined, digital solution is required to replace manual paper logs used for shift handovers. The new system will enhance communication, reduce time loss, and improve productivity by briefing the next shift about critical issues and tasks beforehand.
   
2. **Safety Management Plan (SMP)**: As per DGMS guidelines, every mine must implement an SMP based on hazard identification and control mechanisms. The challenge is to digitalize the SMP for better risk management and to integrate it with ERP systems.

## Solution Overview

**Project Title**: CoalWorks

CoalWorks provides a digital platform to address the issues faced in manual shift handovers and safety management. The software integrates with the current Statutory and non-statutory log formats and adheres to DGMS guidelines. It combines web and app-based platforms with AI and IoT technologies to streamline mining operations.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Web Dashboard**: For supervisors to monitor activities, track tasks, and review shift logs.
- **Mobile App**: For workers to log events like issues, alerts, injuries, etc., and access shift details.
- **AI Assistant**: Helps in round planning, assigning personnel, and hazard detection.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Ensures integration with existing SMPs and logbooks, following DGMS guidelines.
- **OCR Technology**: Scans paper logbooks and converts them into digital forms.
- **ERP Integration**: Supports seamless data migration using data mapping and APIs.

## Features

- **Digital Shift Handover**: Transition logs from paper to digital, ensuring efficient shift handover and improved communication.
- **AI-Driven Productivity**: The AI engine assists in task allocation, hazard detection, and shift planning.
- **SMP Digitalization**: Safety Management Plan (SMP) automation for compliance with DGMS.
- **Predictive Simulation AI**: Supervisors can simulate operations and estimate future needs.
- **IoT Integration**: Ensures cross-validation of operations and safety measures, even in offline scenarios.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: CoalWorks operates smoothly across various environments with Docker integration.
  
**Why We Stand Out:**
- **Predictive Simulation AI Engine**: For simulating mine operations and estimating resource needs.
- **Optimized Workflow and Resource Management**: AI optimizes task allocation and hazard detection.
- **Scalable IoT Deployment**: For cross-validation and safety, ensuring connectivity in remote areas.
- **Cross-Platform Solution**: Works seamlessly across app, web, and IoT systems using Docker integration.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v20.9.0+
- Docker
- PostgreSQL, SQLite, TimeScale DB
- Python 3.x (for AI and simulations)
- Tesseract.js (for OCR functionality)

### Steps

1. **Preferred:** Run the application using Docker for consistency and ease of setup:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

6. (Optional) Start the development server locally if Docker is not used:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coalworks.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd coalworks
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Setup the database by running the migration scripts:
    ```bash
    npm run migrate
    ```
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
---

> **Note:** Docker installation is preferred for a smoother and more consistent environment setup. Using `docker-compose up` will handle dependencies, database, and the application in a unified way.
